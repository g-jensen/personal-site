Recently I used the Interpreter Pattern in my Math Language project and I thought it was interesting,
so I made a presentation about it.

The Interpreter Pattern is mostly used to interpret (you guessed it) complex languages. It could
be used to implement a programming language, similar to what I used it for, or a query language like SQL.
In general, the Interpreter Pattern can be used to interpret any language that has dynamic structure.
For example, something like a `.csv` (Comma Separated Value) file wouldn't need to be interpreted using
the Interpreter Pattern because the structure is completely static (you just read the values after each comma).
But something like a programming language where there could be any number of nests would use the Interpreter Pattern.

The real value of the Interpreter Pattern comes with generating a tree structure of the nodes. The pattern
makes it very easy to create an Abstract Syntax Tree which evaluates a collection of nodes.
