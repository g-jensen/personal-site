Reagent is a library for ClojureScript that allows the creation of React components. I use Reagent for
my TicTacToe ClojureScript implementation, and it is very easy to create a reactive UI. Reagent uses its own
`atom` implementation to keep track of state and update components when that state changes.

If I require Reagent
```clojure
(require '[reagent.core :as r])
(require '[reagent.dom :as rd])
```

I can define a Reagent atom:
```clojure
(def click-count (r/atom 0))
```

And create a component that uses that atom:
```clojure
(defn counting-component []
  [:div
   [:label @click-count]
   [:input {:type "button" :value "Click me!"
            :on-click #(swap! click-count inc)}]])
```

And render that component:

```clojure
(defn ^:export main []
  (rd/render [counting-component] (.getElementById js/document "app")))

(main)
```

This creates a button that has a counter that updates when the button is pressed.
