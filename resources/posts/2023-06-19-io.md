The easiest way to do file reading and writing in Clojure is with `slurp` and `spit`.

Let's say we have a file named `test.txt` with the contents `"hello!"`

`slurp` reads from a file:
```clojure
(slurp "test.txt")
=> "hello!"
```

and `spit` writes to a file:
```clojure
(spit "test.txt" "goodbye!")
=> nil
```
The contents of `test.txt` are now `"goodbye!"`

`spit` can also be used to append to a file by adding `:append true` as parameters like so:
```clojure
(spit "test.txt" "cya!" :append true)
=> nil
```
The contents of `test.txt` are now `"goodbye!cya!"`
