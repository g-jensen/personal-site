`deftype` in Clojure is a way to abstract data away into a structure. It is comparable to `struct` in C.

An example of `struct` in C
```c
typedef struct Rectangle {
    int length;
    int width;
} Rectangle;
```
is easily convertible to an example of `deftype` in Clojure
```clojure
(deftype Rectangle [length width])
```
and the uses are very similar as well
```c
Rectangle r = {5, 4};
printf("%d", r.length*r.width);
```

```clojure
(let [r (Rectangle. 5 4)]
     (println (* (.length r) (.width r))))
```
