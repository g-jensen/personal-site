My newest kata that I am practicing is the "sorting algorithm kata". More specifically, bubble sort. I progress
through the tests based on list size. For example, I start by testing an empty list, then move on to
a list with one element, then two elements, and so on. I'm also making a gui for the kata with Quil. The gui
will display the elements of a list and every time the user presses the space-bar, the next step of the sort will be 
calculated and the display will be updated.
