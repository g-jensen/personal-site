# Pre and Post in Clojure

Pre-conditions are boolean expressions that must evaluate to `true` before a function is evaluated and
post-conditions are the same thing but for after a function's evaluation. If a pre or post condition is
violated, an error will be thrown. Adding pre and post conditions to a function can allow programmers
to ensure dynamic type safety. A pre-condition in Clojure looks like this:
```clojure
(defn factorial [n]
  {:pre [(>= n 0)]}
  (if (= n 0)
    1
    (* n (factorial (dec n)))))
```

Here, the precondition is that `n` is greater than or equal to 0, so if I do `(factorial -1)` the following error is thrown:

```clojure
AssertionError Assert failed: (>= n 0)
```

This style of programming is called Design by Contract, though usually Test Driven Development is used
over Design by Contract to ensure dynamic type safety.
